# Checking for errors is cumbersome

**Answer 1**

I have a feeling that this is one of those things you either accept or don't use Go for.
I don't agree that exceptions are better, but I think it's okay if you don't agree.
However, I don't think you will be able to enjoy using Go or use Go to its full potential if you can't accept this.

# `os.Exit()` is impossible to test!

**Answer 1**

> In other languages, I was able to easily test code that calls `exit`

I think the way to go about it is to only call `os.Exit()` from a single location, and use a return value

```go
package main

func main() {
  if err := _main(); err != nil {
     // decide on the exit code depending on the error, if applicable
     exitCode := ....
     os.Exit(exitCode)
  }
}

func _main() error {
  if err := codeThatCausesExit(); err != nil {
     return err
}
```
